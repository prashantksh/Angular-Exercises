# Angular Training - Day 1

## Exercise 2

In this exercise, we are going to learn TypeScript fundamentals.

1. Clone the repository at [https://github.com/vivekanandpv/TS-Fundamentals](https://github.com/vivekanandpv/TS-Fundamentals)
2. Install TypeScript compiler (if not already done):
   `npm i -g tsc`
3. Open the project in VS Code:
   `$ code .`
4. Go through all the .ts files
5. The TypeScript files cannot be run directly. They have to be transpiled to normal JavaScript by the TypeScript compiler. `tsc source.ts` will produce source.js in the same directory. If you see the project directory, you find that all the files are already transpiled for you.
6. A JavaScript file thus transpiled can be run on node runtime by `$ node file.js`
7. Please copare the TS and resultant JS files
8. Your questions are most welcome!
